# xtraores_ng

`xtraores_ng` is an updated version of the original `xtraores` mod by
`daviddoesminetest` forum user, published at
[daviddoesminetest/Xtraores-](https://github.com/daviddoesminetest/Xtraores-)

This version was originally developed to work well with Mercurio minetest
server, but has some extra configuration options to allow server owners or
single players to configure the mod behavior.
